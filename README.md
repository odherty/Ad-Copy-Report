# Ad-Copy-Report
This is a Python 2 script made by Patrick O'Doherty (1-3-19) (patrickodoherty@growatorchard.com)
It takes two CSV files (one with ad copy information, and another with keyword information) from Google Ad Words
It reads in the data from these two files and generates an output in the form of an XLSX file with XlsxWriter (https://xlsxwriter.readthedocs.io/)
